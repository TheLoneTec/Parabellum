<--------------------------------------- 1.2(Combind with 1.2A) -------------------------------------------->
1.2A - 2 Turrets, 8 new ammo types, more tweaks and research tree changes
*1.2 - 5 Grenades, 1 turret, 3 new ammo type, more tweaks, texture improvements, proper research tree and designate bench for all weapons

Turrets:
*(Nebelwerfer rely a lots of explosive material, such as gunpowders and FSX, since they are not mean to be precision artillery)
-Nebelwerfer 32cm: 28cm/30cm/32cm Nebelwerfer Rockets, 6 barrel/rail rocket launcher(manned - selective fire), Short Range and low projectile velocity for artillery with massive damage
-Wurfrahmen: 28cm/30cm/32cm Nebelwerfer Rockets, Single Rail rocket Launcher(Manned - Single Shot), Short Range and low projectile velocity for artillery with massive damage
-Nebelwerfer 21cm: 21cm/15cm Nebelwerfer Rockets, 5 barrel/rail rocket launcher(manned - selective fire), Medium Range rocket artillery, capable of directfire(with certain ammo type)
*-120mm Wombat Recoiless Anti-Tank Gun,  Single Shot, Short Range stationary light Anti-Tank Weapon

*Mines/Traps:
*-S-mine: Anti-Personnel trip mine, explosive charge with lots of fragments
*-Improvised 4kg Mine: Explosive Trip mine, large explosive radius and decent amount of Fragments.

*Grenades:
-Model 24 Stielhandgranate, standard High Explosive stick grenade, no fragmentation, increased throwing range, low damage with slightly more blast radius, cheap to mass produce
-Model 24 with Splitterring, like above, but with splitter frament cover on the warhead, reduced blast radius exchanging fragmentation damage.
-Model 24 Nebelgranate, use modified warhead to produce smoke screen.
-Model 24 Bundle Charge, 6 + 1 warhead, 7 times the explosive damage, so for the cost, due the increased weight, the throwing range is reduced drastically.
-4kg Demolition Charge, a heavy piece of demolition satchel charge, as soon as you throw it, run for your life.

Ammo:
-28cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, large explosive blast radius with lots of fragmentation and blast damage
-30cm Improved High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, Improved projectile speed, massive explosive blast radius with even more fragmentation and blast damage
-32cm Incendiary Nebelwefer Rocket, massive explosive blast radius with flame damage, can cover a large zone with fire.

-21cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, better projectile speed, due the scale down and modification it weaken the damage effects
-15cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket, even better prejectile speed, but it performance is weaker than average 155mm artillery in single shot
-15cm High Explosive Nebelwerfer Rocket(D), Direct Fire of previous rocket type, reducing the travel time and more accurate with direct targeting, can't aim at targets behind cover though
-15cm Smoke rocket, produce temporary smoke screen to either disturb enemies accuracy or to push and assault.

*-120mm Canister, equivalent of shotgun buckshot but for 120mm gun, lots of spread
*-120mm HESH, High-Explosive Squash Head, high explosive damage with penetration effect, but offers less penetration and fragmentation effect
*-120mm Low Velocity High Explosive, use for indirect fire support, with the same payload as HE shell

Tweaks:
+ Texture Improvements for CGR ammo(no longer small sprites)
+ Updated SK Research Tree adaptation(mostly for turrets, since small fire arms are tied to benches than research trees)
*+ Texture Improvement for XM-307ACSW(remake the entire weapon texture, mostly the turret base)
*+ Texture Improvement for Nebelwerfer(15cm/21cm), now have a bit shiny surface
*- Nerfed Lewis LMG to be more like between the L-15 LMG and Huot AR
*+Changed Mk.14 Mod.0 to behave more like an Late/Endgame Marksman/Battle Rifle rather than a better version of SCAR-H, now with less spawn chance and it performance should be between AR and SR...
*+Increase NbW32 blast Radius and damage, but now they are lot less accurate
