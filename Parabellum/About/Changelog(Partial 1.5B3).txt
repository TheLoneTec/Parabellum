1.5 B3 - 2 Weapon, 5 Turrets, 8 new ammo type, texture improvement, rebalance and tweaks

Melee:
- S83/98III Bayonet: Stab/Poke/Cut, standard issued bayonet of the old empire, decent for stabbing soft target, terrible for anything else

Sniper Rifles:
- Mauser 98k with Zielacht 8x: 8mm Mauser/7.62x51mm NATO, Bolt Action, one of the latest Mauser Rifle, accurate and somewhat long range, now with High Power Optic scope for sniping

Turrets:
- 7.5cm GebK 15: 75mm cannon shell, Single Shot, Late War Light mountain gun, designed to provide ligh artillery/indirect fire support for mountain troops.
- 7.5cm LG 40: 75mm cannon shell, Single Shot, Mid War Light mountain/paratrooper gun, designed to provide ligh artillery/indirect fire support for mountain troops, also provide direct fire anti-tank role, not very efficient one but it gets the job done.(Require open roof to shoot HE shells)
- 7.5cm PaK 40: 75mm cannon shell, Single Shot, Mid War Medium anti-tank gun, designed to deal with medium to heavy armored target of its time, relatively bulky and heavy cannon piece but it has high accuracy and decent RoF.
- 21cm Mörser 16: 21cm Howitzer shell, Single Shot, Heavy Siege Artillery designed to destroy fortification and large structures, very powerful, also very heavy, slow and expensive
- 21cm Mörser 18: 21cm Howitzer shell, Single Shot, Improved/Updated version of the previous one, improved reload speed, range, and accuracy

Ammo:
- Shotgun SaltShot round, Rock Salt, custom made less-than-lethal round for shotgun, cause lots of pain and blindness when manage to damage the target, very ineffective counter armored and thick skin target, even worse for Mechanical pawns
- 7.5cm Pzgr 39(APCBC-HE),Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Cap - High Explosive, mostly metal slug and some explosive charge, capped with ballistic cap to increase its trajectory stability
- 7.5cm Sprgr.Patr.34(HE): High Explosive, standard ammo type for heavy Flak guns, big enough to damage medium and even heavy armored target with direct hit
- 7.5cm Pzgr 40(APCR),Armor Piercing Composite Rigid, designed to increase anti-tank penetration more than average AP shell does, which sacrifice its fragmentation capability and being more expensive to produce
- 7.5cm Gr.Patr.38 HL/B(HEAT), High Explosive Anti-Tank ammunition for light artillery and assault gun, usually short barrel cannon, to give them anti-tank capability during unexpected encounter with armored target.
- 21cm Gr 18(AC), Anti-Concrete round, primitive bunker buster round, designed to specifically to destroy fortification and large structure(Direct Fire for Mörser 18)
- 21cm Gr 18(HE), High Explosive round, a large size High Explosive shell filled with TNT and fragments, the size of the shell and its payload is powerful enough to put most land unit out of compat with direct hit
- 21cm Gr 18 Be(APHE), High Explosive Anti-Concrete round, Improved version of the previous one, with larger explosive payload and fragment but it reduce the direct impact damage

Tweaks:
+ Now light Turrets can be unistall/undeploy faster
+ Now 88mm RPzB GR. 4992(Frag) is capable of direct fire
